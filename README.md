This is my attempt at craeting a todo application in C, for no reason other than I want to learn the language and data structures.

I think this is a fun / somewhat challenging project that has significantly improved my understanding of pointers and linked lists.

It's no where near complete and I'm working on it day-by-day when I have the chance. So far, I have craeted the node struct, allowed the user to add a task, and delete a task through specifying the index.

I would like to make the user-experince more fluid, but that is not on the list of priorities for this project. I just want to make sure:
a) I understand the functionality that goes into a todo list
b) I can implement those functions

Something I have wanted to do in this project is to place asserts everywhere as a means of avoiding errors/understanding where I have gone wrong.

So far with my limited experience I have run into seg faults on numerous occasions and have spent more time debugging. I have seen online that asserts may help me when debugging.
